/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global binding - in the global scope the value of "this" is the console.
* 2. Implicit binding - when called by a preceding dot, the object left of the dot gets "this".
* 3. New binding - When a constructor function is used, 'this' is the specific
    instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
* 4. Explicit binding - When JavaScript's call or apply method is used, 'this'
    is explicitly defined.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
